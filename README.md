TESTING 
1) Header - Title shows, 3 links exist, href correct. 
getByText, getByRole('link'), getAllByRole('link')

2) Footer -  Footer text shows current year; correct role (contentinfo); no extra links
getByRole('contentinfo'), getByText, queryByRole('link')

3) EventCard - Renders event details (name, date, location, description, seats); Book Now button exists and fires callback.
getByText, getByRole('heading'), getByRole('button'), fireEvent.click

4) EventList - Renders multiple events; clicking Book opens modal; Close/Confirm hides modal.
getByText, getAllByText, getByRole('button'), queryByText, fireEvent.click

5) DateFilter
Renders date input with label; input type is date; changing value calls onChange; safe when missing prop
getByLabelText, fireEvent.change

6) SearchBar
Renders input (searchbox) + Clear button; typing triggers onSearch; Clear resets value
getByRole('searchbox'), getByRole('button'), fireEvent.change, fireEvent.click

7) BookingModal
Has dialog role; shows event name; BookingForm rendered; Cancel calls onClose; Confirm calls onConfirm
getByRole('dialog'), getByText, fireEvent.click, getByTestId.

8) BookingForm
Inputs (name, email, quantity) render; updates values; shows errors (empty fields, too many seats); Cancel & Confirm work
getByLabelText, getByText, fireEvent.change, fireEvent.click
